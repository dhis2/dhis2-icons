# DHIS2 Icons
DHIS2 uses a enum of all icons to contain all the information about what icons are available and their descriptions and keywords.
The dhis2-icon-tool.jar in this repository is a tool to validate the files and icon data to point out any inconsistensies, and to generate a list of items used in the java enum in DHIS2.
